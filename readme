window manager (unnamed).

todo:
-----
  [ ] proper 'focus' change for multiple scenarios (on window destroyed, ws
      switched, move client to ws etc).
  [X] Properly kill client on keypress.
  [X] proper logging for statusbar.
  [ ] rules for managing windows (docks, dialogs, statusbar etc).
  [ ] Client init hooks (switch ws, floating etc).
  [X] process starts but cannot write to pipe.
  [ ] simple click to focus.

bugs:
-----
  [ ] need to know if the statusbar (pipefile) terminated (currently program
      will just crashes because the program holds the pointer to the file
      stream, if the file stream closes, the pointer should be nullified).

MapRequest
  - create client if doesn't exists (safe to do so, as this event is only fired
    on windows with 'override_redirect' set to false).
  - tag client as 'active'.
  - attach to selected workspace.
MapNotify
  - set border with respect to the workspace.
  - if active, the set focus.
  - arrange.
UnmapNotify:
  - frees the client for the window (for layout purposes).
ConfigureRequest
  - configure and arrange.
PropertyNotify
  - log to statsubar.
KeyPress
  - call key bindings.
ButtonPress
  - grab client and pointer coordinates.
  - call button bindings.
MotionNotify
  - update grabbed coordinates.
ButtonRelease
  - reset grabbed.
DestroyNotify
  - detach client if found in any workspace (not just selected).
  - focus immediate neighbouring client.
  - free client.
